# Blackjack Project

## Overview:
This project collectively encompassed everything we have been learning into this one project. This gave me more practice learning how to read what the User is looking for and being able to write it in Java.

## Topics:
1. OOP
2. Methods with constructors
3. Abstraction
4. Switch statements
5. Enumerated types
6. Collections (shuffle)
7. Array List
8. Unicode/ASCII Art

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to write a better UML Diagram as well as create my own classes and put what needs to be in that UML Diagram. By doing this, it gave me a more organized code and gave me a better understanding of how each class was to be used and how some classes would extend each other and inherent those traits. It also gave me more practice writing the code and actually thinking about what  each method was called to do. Also, because I am not fluent in Blackjack it made me do some research on it so that I would effectively be able to write the code being asked of me.


## How to Play: Blackjack

1. The Dealer deals two hands of cards - one to the Dealer and the other to the Player. The Player can choose wether they want to "Hit or Stand".

2. If the Dealer's hand total is below 17, the Dealer must Hit, if the hand total is 17 or above, the Dealer must Stand.

3. After each round it will determine who the Winner is and prompt the user if they would like to play again or quit the game?
